# SEI-Project-2-Grindhouse
## Overview

For project #2, I created a website where users can perform CRUD on alt accounts, axis accounts, and comments.

I had plans for a better website, but had to scale back due to time and difficulty with the assignment.

**Live Site:** <https://guarded-oasis-67077.herokuapp.com/>

## Future Development

  * Have Alt accounts nested with an Axis account
  * Have comments nested to an Alt account
  * Be able to buy an Alt account from another Axis account and add it to your other Alt accounts connected to your Axis account
